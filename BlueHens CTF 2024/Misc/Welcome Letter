Welcome Letter
50
Welcome to the CTF. A few notes:

* I made 10 XOR School problems, we're a uni so teaching will always be part of our CTFs.  These are made as an ode to the beauty of XOR.  

* Some Training problems in the main categories: Reverse, PWN, Web, and Crypto just for first-timers.  Google the problem title + "CTF Writeup" and you'll find similar problems out there that you can mimic I'm sure.

* In playtesting many of the problems were fun puzzles but I can imagine someone calling them "guessy", forgive us now.  I killed any that felt egregious and the others I've labelled as "guess school".  Behind that label is the idea that deductive reasoning within the meta of CTFing is actuallyy a muscle.  Many (very good) teams have a member that specializes in guessy problems.  I think that XOR and the guess school problems cultivate a sort of "escape room" sensibility that often is overlooked in CTF training as too frustrating.  I think it's valuable as a life skill but consider this a trigger warning, stay away from those ones if you tend to get frustrated.

* I tried to make sure the main categories have enough depth to chew on but not all of the main categories are equally as deep.  I think PWN and WEB are maybe a little lighter than perfection but we have a ton of challenges and 12 less hours, so your WEB anchor might need to go help someone else after day 1.

* We're a student club.  Every year students make problems.  They are fun and quirky but this year they made a TON of forensics and misc and problems that maybe crawl over several categories.  The heavy hitting teams might not love that but our deepest problems tend to get deeper and our n00b problems stay light, just the nature of undergrads.  Just have fun with it.

* We pride ourselves on customer service, jump in the discord and ask questions and I'll try to teach you stuff without lessening the competitive integrity of the competition.

* Some authors used udctf{} others used UDCTF{} so bear that in mind when validating your hypotheses.

* We have a long history of a minecraft category, this year we don't.  Sorry.  I miss it.  FSG lives on in ranked.
