I have tried to perform the math in a calculator. Math error is all I see.

So I did a little bit of google search on this
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_mathematical_symbols

Stumbled apon Subfactorials for the !87  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subfactorial

 wrote the code

import math

factorial_78 = math.factorial(78)
print(factorial_78)

def subfactorial(n, memo={}):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    elif n == 1:
        return 0

    # Check if the value has already been computed
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]

    memo[n] = (n - 1) * (subfactorial(n - 1, memo) + subfactorial(n - 2, memo))

    return memo[n]

subfactorial_87 = subfactorial(87)
print(subfactorial_87)


k = (factorial_78 + subfactorial_87) // 2
print(f"udctf{{{k}}}")

 boom volia flag
